                    River-Crossover "Fisherman" is the smallest model of airboat supplied by South Pacific Airboats,which has the length of 
                    5.4 m, the width of  2.1m and empty weight of 225 kg.  The 50hp engine will  produce a 55kph gliding speed on water.  
                    The "Fisherman" is one of the most popular of River-crossover airboats and can transport two people and up to 200 kg of cargo.
                </p>
                <p class="spacing about_page">
                    River-Crossover "Outback" is a medium size Airboat with a length of 5.8m, the width of 2.3m and empty weight of 390kg. 
                    The 100hp engine will produce a gliding speed of 70kph on water. Spacious and comfortable for four people plus an additional 
                    200kg of equipment, the Outback is a user friendly family size Airboat to take you there and back. The large front section 
                    of the "Outback" doubles as a tent and will sleep three full size adults or two adults and two children.
                </p>
                <p class="spacing about_page">
                    River-Crossover "Ranger" has a slightly longer and wider hull than the Outback and is fitted with a 150hp engine. For those 
                    folk who enjoy exploring back country rivers or hunting expeditions the "Ranger" with extra load caring capacity is a serious 
                    contender for the adventure seekers who enjoy the freedom of ranging further up the river and camping out for a few days.

                <p class="spacing about_page">
                    River-Crossover "Discovery" is a 240hp powerful six seat airboat with a gliding speed of 90kph. The hull length is 6.8m, width 
                    2.45m and a carrying capacity of personnel and equipment up to 1000kg. Ideal for tourism, long distance transport or commercial 
                    applications. The Discovery runs extreme shallows and has the power to also take on large river rapids with ease.

                <p class="spacing about_page" id="Flexible_Hull">
                    River-Crossover "Explorer" is the largest airboat in the River-Crossover range with a hull length of 7.3m and a width of 2.6m. 
                    Big brother to the Discovery, the ten seat 260hp "Explorer" is very much a tourist operators craft.  Low operational costs and 
                    maintenance makes for an attractive package. Deep water wide lakes to winding stony shallows, or shooting the rapids for fun... 
                    a thrill for all.

                    The River-Crossover Airboat is a low-weight high-speed all-weather inflatable boat that uses aerodynamic propulsion. 
                    The hull comprises of several inflated low pressure pontoons (PVC fabric tubes) that are protected on the underside 
                    by reinforced abrasion resistant sections that resemble fish scales. The main advantage of this flexible hull design 
                    is the ability to cross over many surfaces like low-water stony rivers and creeks, rapids, river shingle, sand, mud, 
                    swamps, snow, ice and land with relative ease and with no discomfort to passengers.

                    Taking you to places where other water craft have difficulty, the River-Crossover Airboats have far more maneuverability and 
                    carry twice the load of a hovercraft of a similar size. Also, River-Crossover Airboats will run extreme shallows 
                    without being grounded as compared to a jet boat.

                    There are two Aerodynamic rudders for the small to medium craft and four on the larger craft. Positioned in the propeller slipstream, 
                    the rudders are angled inward toward the top pivot point like an inverted V .This style of rudder setting has a desirable 
                    tendency to lean the craft into the turn and assist maneuvering in narrow winding rivers or confined areas.

                    Currently there are five River-Crossover Airboats to choose from, ranging from a 2-seat 500kg loading capacity, to a 10-seat 1200kg 
                    loading capacity, or a combination of seating and cargo. Also, variants of seating placement and style are available within the range. 
                    Speeds attainable on water will depend on the loading of the Airboat, although in general, 70km/h for the smaller Airboats and up to 110km/h 
                    for the larger more powerful Airboats.

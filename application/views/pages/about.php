                    The River-Crossover Airboat is a low-weight high-speed all-weather inflatable boat that uses aerodynamic propulsion. 
                    The hull comprises of several inflated low pressure pontoons (PVC fabric tubes) that are protected on the underside 
                    by reinforced abrasion resistant sections that resemble fish scales. The main advantage of this flexible hull design 
                    is the ability to cross over many surfaces like low-water stony rivers and creeks, rapids, river shingle, sand, mud, 
                    swamps, snow, ice and land with relative ease and with no discomfort to passengers.

                    Taking you to places where other water craft have difficulty, the River-Crossover Airboats have far more maneuverability and 
                    carry twice the load of a hovercraft of a similar size. Also, River-Crossover Airboats will run extreme shallows 
                    without being grounded as compared to a jet boat.

                    Safe and easily operated, the all-weather River-Crossover Airboat can be used for fishing and hunting, 
                    sightseeing and adventure tourism, search and rescue in tidal and frequently flooded areas, geological 
                    exploration purposes, military applications, or just having a boatload of fun with family and friends.

                    In South Pacific countries, Suzuki, Subaru and Toyota automobile engines power the series of River-Crossover Airboats. 
                    The engines range from 1.2-litre to 4.2-litre and are fitted with an aviation reduction gearbox coupled to a wide blade 
                    low noise composite aero propeller.

                    There are two Aerodynamic rudders for the small to medium craft and four on the larger craft. Positioned in the propeller slipstream, 
                    the rudders are angled inward toward the top pivot point like an inverted V .This style of rudder setting has a desirable 
                    tendency to lean the craft into the turn and assist maneuvering in narrow winding rivers or confined areas.

                    Currently there are six River-Crossover Airboats to choose  from, ranging from a 4-seat 500kg loading capacity, to a 10-seat 1200kg 
                    loading capacity, or a combination of seating and cargo.  Also, variants of seating placement and style are available within the range. 
                    Speeds attainable on water will depend on the loading of the Airboat, although in general, 70km/h for the smaller Airboats and up to 
                    110km/h for the larger more powerful Airboats.

                    Easy to drive, our River-Crossover Airboats will take you to places that were previously unreachable with other craft. 
                    We are sure, that once you try our Airboats, you'll have a smile on your face as wide as the Pacific Ocean....

                    Airboat "Piranha-1" is the smallest model of airboat supplied by SPAirboats, which has the length of 3.5 m, the width of 1.45 m and the weight of 200 kg. 
                    It can take 2 people of medium weight and be loaded with fuel and equipment with a total weight which should not exceed 300 kg.

                    Airboat "Piranha-2" is one of the most popular types of airboats. It can transport 3-4 people and up to 200 kg of cargo.

                    Airboat "Piranha-3" is longer and wider, and also has an additional base in the craft. Now, instead of 3 longitudinal tubes it has 4. 
                    They are based symmetrically to each other and provide a steady platform. Now, it is spacious enough and quite comfortable for 4 people, 
                    and moves at the speed up to 70 km/h, having on board some equipment, food and fuel.

                    The River-Crossover Airboat is a low-weight high-speed all-weather inflatable boat that uses aerodynamic propulsion. 
                    The hull comprises of several inflated low pressure pontoons (PVC fabric tubes) that are protected on the underside 
                    by reinforced abrasion resistant sections that resemble fish scales. The main advantage of this flexible hull design 
                    is the ability to cross over many surfaces like low-water stony rivers and creeks, rapids, river shingle, sand, mud, 
                    swamps, snow, ice and land with relative ease and with no discomfort to passengers.

                    Taking you to places where other water craft have difficulty, the River-Crossover Airboats have far more maneuverability and 
                    carry twice the load of a hovercraft of a similar size. Also, River-Crossover Airboats will run extreme shallows 
                    without being grounded as compared to a jet boat.

                    loading capacity, or a combination of seating and cargo.  Also, variants of seating placement and style are available within the range. 
                    Speeds attainable on water will depend on the loading of the Airboat, although in general, 70km/h for the smaller Airboats and up to 
                    110km/h for the larger more powerful Airboats.
